## The Need for Live TV, Wherever You Are

Living outside Pakistan makes you realize how much of your daily rhythm used to revolve around local news, especially on TV. The 9 PM bulletin, the scrolling tickers, the heated debates on talk shows—love them or hate them—they were a part of our daily lives.

I’m Atif, and like many Pakistanis abroad, I now live in Sweden. It’s beautiful here, but nothing matches the emotional chaos of a live Pakistani news broadcast. The anchors arguing, the breaking news banners flashing every few minutes, and yes, even the “breaking” news that isn’t really breaking—it all hits differently.

## Why Live TV Still Matters

Even in the age of social media and YouTube, **live news coverage has a unique importance**. On election nights, during major court rulings, or when political twists unfold, *live TV gives you the full picture in real time*, not just the edited highlights.

But watching Pakistani TV channels abroad is harder than it should be. You either:

- End up searching random websites  
- Land on pages that no longer work  

It’s frustrating—especially when all you want is a quick, reliable stream of what’s happening back home.

## So I Built a Simple Solution

Since I was already building [PakStream](https://www.pakstream.com) to stream Pakistani FM radio and curate reliable YouTube journalists, I decided to add **live TV channels** too.

Just like the radio and Free Press sections, my goal was to make it:

- **Clean**  
- **One-click easy**  

No spammy redirects. No broken players. Just working links to **popular Pakistani news channels**, all in one place.

## My Go-To Channels

Currently, the live TV section includes channels I personally check most:

- Geo News  
- ARY News  
- Express News  
- BOL News  
- GNN  
- SAMAA TV  
- 24 News  
- PTV News  
- HUM News  
- Dunya News  
- 92 News  

Each opens in a separate, mobile-friendly player, so whether you’re at work, commuting, or relaxing at home, you’re one click away from the headlines.

## Built for People Like Us

PakStream isn’t backed by sponsors, media houses, or advertisers. It’s simply something I built to **stay connected to Pakistan in a meaningful way**.

Whether you’re in Europe, the Middle East, North America, or anywhere else, I know many of you feel the same—we want to stay informed without the headache of chasing links every time there’s breaking news.

## Suggest a Channel—Let’s Build Together

If there’s a Pakistani TV channel you love that isn’t listed, **let me know in the comments**. I’d be happy to add it so others can benefit.

This is a community-driven project. The more we collaborate, the better the experience for everyone.

## Final Words

PakStream began as a personal project, but it’s growing into a digital corner for Pakistanis abroad. First radio, then YouTubers, now live TV—and more to come.

So go ahead. Bookmark it. Share it. Use it during your morning chai or late-night news scroll.

Let’s keep the connection alive—one click at a time.
