## Assalamualaikum and Welcome! 🇵🇰

If you’ve landed here, **thank you**. This blog is part of a journey I’m excited to share with you.

I’m Atif—a software developer in Sweden, but forever a Pakistani at heart. No matter where life takes us, the sounds, flavors, humor, and chaos of Pakistan never leave us.

## Why This Blog Exists

PakStream began as a personal tool: a clean way to listen to Pakistani radio, follow news, and watch trusted YouTubers—without pop-ups or broken links.

Then I thought, **maybe I’m not the only one who misses this**. That’s when I opened it up for everyone.

This blog tells that story—how it started, where it’s going, and most importantly, how *you* can shape it.

## Built with Vibes, Not Just Code

This site was made through what I call *“vibe coding”*: late nights, chai, lo-fi music, and the urge to build something real. No corporate plans—just passion.

It’s not perfect, but it’s built with honesty and love.

## What You’ll Find Here

- The story behind PakStream  
- New features and updates  
- Nostalgia, culture, and life abroad  
- Recommendations for radio, YouTubers, and TV  
- Messages and ideas from you, the community  

If you’re looking to [watch Pakistani TV](/livetv.html) or [follow popular YouTubers](/blog/2025/07/31/youtubers-for-news.html), those sections are ready.

## Let’s Build Together

I may run this solo, but I don’t want to build it alone. Share your ideas, favorite stations, or trusted journalists. Many site features come from user suggestions.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope something here makes your day—maybe even hearing a familiar voice from back home.

**Once a Pakistani, always a Pakistani.** 🇵🇰  
Our roots stay strong, no matter where we go.

– *Atif*
