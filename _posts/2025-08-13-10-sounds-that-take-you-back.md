## A Journey Back, Through Sound

Living abroad changes many things—but some memories are so deeply tied to your senses that even thousands of miles away, one familiar sound can bring them rushing back. For Pakistanis abroad, *sound* is one of the strongest triggers of nostalgia.

Whether you grew up in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, or a small town in Punjab, here are **10 sounds that instantly transport us back to Pakistan**—no matter where we are today.

---

### **1. The Azaan at Dawn**
The soft echo of the *Fajr* azaan drifting through the stillness of early morning is something no recording can truly capture. It’s not just a call to prayer—it’s a reminder of home, of community, and of beginnings.

---

### **2. Cricket Commentary**
“**Aur yeh gaya… SIXER!**” — Whether from Radio Pakistan or PTV Sports, cricket commentary carries the thrill of street matches, Eid cricket tournaments, and the joy of a win that unites the entire nation.

---

### **3. The Rickshaw Horn**
That cheerful, slightly comical honk of a rickshaw weaving through traffic is as much a part of the urban soundtrack as the call of a chai-wala. One beep, and you’re back on Saddar Road or Liberty Market.

---

### **4. FM Radio Morning Shows**
From *RJ Sophie’s* laughter to quirky caller requests, Pakistani FM morning shows make traffic jams bearable and mornings lively. A mix of gossip, jokes, and that one old Atif Aslam song—perfect.

---

### **5. Street Vendor Calls**
“**Aaloo le lo! Tamaatar le lo!**” — The melodic calls of street vendors in every neighborhood, whether they’re selling fruit, vegetables, or household goods, are pure Pakistan. Every city, every accent, every tone—unique yet familiar.

---

### **6. Eid Mubarak Firecrackers**
If you’ve spent an Eid in Pakistan, you know the sound. Kids running with *phuljharis*, firecrackers popping in the distance, and the laughter of cousins in the courtyard.

---

### **7. Political Talk Shows**
Anchors raising their voices, guests talking over each other, and a breaking news banner flashing every 5 minutes—love it or hate it, this is Pakistan’s prime-time drama.

---

### **8. Train Horns**
From Karachi Cantt to Lahore Junction, the deep horn of a departing train holds stories of family trips, chai in small cups, and long goodbyes on crowded platforms.

---

### **9. The Call of the Chai-Wala**
“**Chai garam! Chai garam!**” — Whether on a cold Murree night or in a busy Karachi office, the chai-wala’s voice cuts through all conversations, because chai is never just a drink—it’s an emotion.

---

### **10. Mehndi & Wedding Dhol**
The thumping rhythm of a dhol at a wedding instantly makes your feet move, no matter how far you are from home. The sound of celebration, tradition, and togetherness.
