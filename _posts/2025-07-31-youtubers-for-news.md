## From Headlines to Real Talk

Staying connected to Pakistan while living abroad isnâ€™t easy. You miss your people, your food, your streetsâ€”and even the chaos of the 9 PM news. For me, one habit has never changed: **starting my day with Pakistani news over breakfast**.

In Pakistan, catching the morning headlines is almost a ritual. That habit followed me to Sweden. But over time, I noticed a shift in how I consumed newsâ€”and I think many of you will relate.

## Why Traditional TV News Isnâ€™t Enough

Letâ€™s be honestâ€”**TV news alone often canâ€™t be trusted to tell the full story**. Between commercial pressure, political influence, and biased reporting, finding factual news on mainstream channels has become harder.

Like many, I turned to **independent journalists on YouTube**. Many are ex-TV anchors now free to speak openly. They explain politics in plain language and report fearlessly.

For example:

- [Imran Riaz Khan](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=ImranRiazKhan) dives into judiciary and civil-military issues.  
- [Sabir Shakir](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=SabirShakir) often breaks stories before TV does.  
- [Sami Abraham](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=SamiAbraham), [Mansoor Ali Khan](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=MansoorAliKhan), and [Moeed Pirzada](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=MoeedPirzada) bring distinct perspectives.  
- Rising voices like [Syed Ali Haider](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=AliHaider), [Siddique Jaan](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=SiddiqueJaan), and [Usama Ghazi](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=UsamaGhazi) cover realities often ignored by mainstream media.

## The Problem: Scattered Subscriptions

Every morning, Iâ€™d open YouTube and search through subscriptions for the latest videos. Sometimes the algorithm helped, sometimes it didnâ€™t. It was inefficient.

So I thoughtâ€”why not bring them all together?

## One Page for All the Journalists

I built a page on [PakStream](https://www.pakstream.com) with **all my favorite YouTubers in one place**. No algorithm. No ads. No noise.

Access it here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://pakstream.com/freepress.html](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html)  

Or jump directly to someoneâ€™s section:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=ImranRiazKhan](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=ImranRiazKhan)

Some featured names:

- [Imran Riaz Khan](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=ImranRiazKhan)  
- [Sabir Shakir](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=SabirShakir)  
- [Sami Abraham](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=SamiAbraham)  
- [Mansoor Ali Khan](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=MansoorAliKhan)  
- [Moeed Pirzada](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=MoeedPirzada)  
- [Mubasher Lucman](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=MubasherLucman)  
- [Syed Ali Haider](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=AliHaider)  
- [Siddique Jaan](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=SiddiqueJaan)  
- [Usama Ghazi](https://pakstream.com/freepress.html?newsanchor=UsamaGhazi)  

## Why This Matters

This small change improved my daily routine. Now I can enjoy my morning chai without algorithm games.

It also supports independent journalism. These creators speak truth despite risks, and watching their work helps sustain them.

## Your Suggestions Are Welcome

If you follow a journalist not listed, **let me know**. Iâ€™ll add them.

PakStream is a labor of loveâ€”not sponsored, not corporate. Just a digital tool for Pakistanis abroad.

## Final Thoughts

In a world full of misinformation, honest voices matter. Thatâ€™s why I built thisâ€”to help us stay informed without the noise.

Visit [PakStream](https://www.pakstream.com), explore Free Press, and if it helps you, share it with friends abroad.
