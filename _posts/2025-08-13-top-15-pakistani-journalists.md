## Why This List Matters

In 2025, news moves faster than everâ€”but finding **honest, fact-based reporting** isnâ€™t easy.  
Mainstream media often carries political bias or corporate influence, making it difficult to get the full picture.

Thatâ€™s why I built the **Free Press** section on [PakStream](https://www.pakstream.com)â€”to bring together journalists who deliver credible, timely, and in-depth analysis, all in one place.

Here are **15 Pakistani journalists you should follow in 2025** to stay informed, especially if you live abroad.
