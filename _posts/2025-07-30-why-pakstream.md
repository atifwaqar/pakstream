## Life Away from the Homeland

There’s something about the streets of Pakistan—the honking rickshaws, the vibrant colors, the azaan echoing through the air, and FM radio playing everything from old songs to political debates. These aren’t just background noises—they’re the sounds of home.

I’m Atif, a Pakistani living in Sweden. It’s peaceful here, but nothing replaces the raw, energetic vibe of Pakistan. The longer you stay away, the more you miss the little things: Karachi traffic, the sudden “light chali gayi” moments, and above all, Pakistani radio.

## The Craving for Local Radio

One morning on my drive to work in Sweden, I remembered how in Pakistan I’d have FM 91 or City FM 89 playing in the background. Radio wasn’t just entertainment—it was connection.

I searched “Pakistani radio online” and found many stations streamed live. But most websites were outdated, full of broken links, or overloaded with pop-ups. That’s when I decided to build my own solution.

## From Idea to Reality

Being a software developer, I made a simple, ad-free page with my favorite stations—just one click to play.

I called it **PakStream** (“Pakistan Stream”). It became part of my daily routine while working, cooking, or relaxing. A friend tried it and said, “Yaar, this is brilliant—make it public!” That’s when I knew others missed this too.

## Introducing PakStream.com

I launched [www.pakstream.com](https://www.pakstream.com) to give overseas Pakistanis a **small window into home**. Whether in London, Dubai, Toronto, or Oslo—you can tune in instantly.

Some of my favorites:

- City FM 89  
- FM 100 Pakistan  
- Mast FM 103  
- Power99  
- Apna Karachi FM 107  

Each station opens in a clean, mobile-friendly player. No ads. No clutter.

## Growing Beyond Radio

My plan includes:

- **More Radio Stations** – including regional ones  
- **Live TV Channels** – stream Geo, ARY, PTV, and more  
- **YouTube Commentary** – trusted independent journalists  
- **Community Suggestions** – so we build together

If you’re looking to [watch Pakistani TV live](/livetv.html) or [follow Pakistani YouTubers](/blog/2025/07/31/youtubers-for-news.html), those sections are ready too.

## Why Radio Still Matters

Radio is **live**. **Local**. It reflects the **mood of the city**. Spotify can’t tell you about a traffic jam on Shahrah-e-Faisal. YouTube won’t surprise you with a caller dedicating a ghazal.

## Let’s Keep Pakistan Close

Millions of Pakistanis live abroad but remain emotionally tied to their homeland. PakStream is my small effort to keep that connection alive—one station, one click at a time.

Visit [www.pakstream.com](https://www.pakstream.com), try it, and share it. Let’s make this our digital little Pakistan.
